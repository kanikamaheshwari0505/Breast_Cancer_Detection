🩺 Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

A simple and effective machine learning project to classify breast tumors as Benign or Malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset.
The entire workflow is implemented in Jupyter Notebook with clear steps and visualizations.

🚀 Overview

*Loads and analyzes the dataset

*Preprocesses and scales features

*Trains multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, KNN)

*Compares their accuracy and evaluation metrics

*Visualizes correlations and confusion matrices

🔧 Tech Used

->Python

->Jupyter Notebook

->Pandas, NumPy

->Matplotlib, Seaborn

->Scikit-learn

📊 Dataset

*569 samples

*30 features

*Target: Malignant (0) or Benign (1)

*Available in sklearn.datasets

🏗️ Workflow
